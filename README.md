# myip
Simple Batch Application for filtering the results of ipconfig /all on windows machines

-- TO USE --

1. Please either myip.bat or myip.exe into your windows system32 folder, this should allow windows search to find it easily
2. In windows search / win key simply type myip and press enter


If you want to compile your own EXE using your own .ico file or custom changes I recommend using the free compiler @ www.f2ko.de

There is both an online version, and an offline version that can be used.
